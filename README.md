## ğŸ“– Project Overview

In this project, I used binary masking technique to segment tumors in MRI brain scan slices. The segmented images highlight tumor boundaries, and distinguish multi-region tumors using intensity differences and region labeling.

This can assist medical practitioners or serve as a proof-of-concept for more advanced models.

## Objective

- Detect and visualize tumor regions in brain CT images.
- Label nested and overlapping tumors with separate colors.
- Improve visibility by applying masks and filtering borders.
- Enable easy inspection and interpretation of segmented regions.

---

##  Methodology

1. **Data**
   - Loaded `.nii` image using `nibabel`  
2. **Segmentation via binary masking**
   - Tumor regions identified by pixel intensities (image > 8000) & (image <= 10500) pixel values
   - Separated high and low intensity tumors using color-mesh
3. **Masking**
   - Binary masks created using NumPy
4. **Border Clearing**
   - `skimage.segmentation.clear_border()` used to remove artifacts
5. **Labeling**
   - `skimage.measure.regionprops() to identify tumor regions and their properties such as area, bounding boxes, center_of_mass  
   - `scipy.measure.label()` to label connected regions and identified region areas
6. **Visualization**
   - `matplotlib.pyplot.pcolormesh()` for color visualization
   - `scipy.ndimage.zoom() to reduce axes dimensions  
   - `plotly.graph_objects() for 3D visualisation of segmented tumors

## Results

Example segmented slice (slice index = 110):

| Original | Segmented |
|----------|-----------|

Nested tumors:
- Small tumor : Higher intensity
- Larger tumor: Moderately Lower intensity, re-labeled as a distinct region
